        What's the first thing that comes to your mind when you
        hear the word ‘cells’?
        For Stephen Wetter, it’s art. Wetter is BC’s first
        national gold key winner in 17 years, and it hasn’t been
        without a lot of hard work.
        Throughout high school, he spent countless hours
        compiling a large quantity of paintings and drawings to
        prove his skill and love for the arts. Wetter created and
        finalized his nationally-ranked piece in Mrs. Scott’s class
        over the duration of Art Seminar with Ms. Sarah Scott
        and named it “Cells.”
        “It’s always a hard decision to decide which artwork
        I want to send off to get judged,” Scott admitted. “It’s like
        picking a favorite child, but I knew that with Stephen he
        truly had what it took.”
        The process wasn’t very easy. The piece was
        originally sent out and put on display in downtown
        Milwaukee at the Milwaukee Public Art Museum, where
        after receiving multiple awards from local critics, it was
        sent to be judged in New York City at the national level.
        This wait was agonizing for Wetter, but the final award
        proved worth it. Winning this award meant that Stephen’s
        work was considered by prestigious artists, writers, and
        professionals across the nation to be among the top one
        percent of all young artists, an unimaginable honor.
        After Wetter’s artwork won the most elite prize
        possible, it began a long two-year journey back to New
        York, after a brief visit home, where it will travel from
        gallery to gallery around the U.S. to display the true
        brilliance of the piece for museum-goers. With his piece
        traveling, and the stress and anxiety from the judging
        over, Stephen continues to add to his ever growing
        collection of art with a newfound confidence thanks to
        the success of a piece that some could say wasn’t such a
        hard cell.
